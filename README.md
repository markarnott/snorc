This is my prototype "testing grounds" where I build utilities for WSL.

These tools are focused on making WSL development environments easier to work with.

## Documentation

### Converting a container to WSL

[How-To-Convert-Docker-Image-To-WSL](docs/How-To-Convert-Docker-Image-To-WSL.md)

### Clone an existing WSL Instance

```powershell
cd pwsh
Clone-WslDistro.ps1 -NewDistroName "MyTools"
```
